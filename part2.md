Welcome to the homepage for the second half of [COMP3204](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP3204) and [COMP6223](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP6223).

This half of the course will be taught through a series of lectures presented with a number of interactive slides and demonstrations. The Java source-code of these demonstrations can be downloaded from the [course's github page](http://github.com/jonhare/COMP3204), where you'll find instructions on how they can be compiled. Feel free to create your own fork of the source, and contribute back improvements (or even bug fixes!). The slides are also available in static PDF format - these can be downloaded from the links in the table below, together with PDF copies of the handouts provided in the lecture.

To run the interactive slides and demos application shown in the lecture you'll need to have Java 6 or later installed. The most recently compiled version of the interactive slides and demos can be downloaded from our continuous integration system [here](http://jenkins.ecs.soton.ac.uk/job/COMP3204/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/app/target/COMP3204-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar). This will be updated frequently throughout the course as the lecture material is finalised. After downloading, you should be able to run the jar by double clicking on it, or running from the command-line with `java -jar COMP3204-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. 

The launcher program that opens when you launch the jar is self explanatory, but once you've selected a presentation or demo you can make it full screen by pressing "f" (press again to exit). For the presentations you can use the left and right arrow keys to navigate. Note that on some of the interactive slides, you might need to click on the slide background for the arrow keys to work if you clicked on any controls other than buttons.
