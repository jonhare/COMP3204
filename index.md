Welcome to the homepage for the ECS [COMP3204 "Computer Vision"](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP3204) module. 

The challenge of computer vision is to develop a computer based system with the capabilities of the human eye-brain system. It is therefore primarily concerned with the problem of capturing and making sense of digital images. The field draws heavily on many subjects including digital image processing, artificial intelligence, computer graphics and psychology.

This course will explore some of the basic principles and techniques from these areas which are currently being used in real-world computer vision systems and the research and development of new systems.

The following short video gives an overview of what to expect in the module.

## Lectures & Teaching

The lectures for this course will be given by [Professor Mark Nixon](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/msn) ([email](mailto:msn@ecs.soton.ac.uk)) and <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jsh2">Dr Jonathon Hare</a> ([email](mailto:jsh2@ecs.soton.ac.uk)). Given the situation regarding COVID and the availability of physical space on campus we will be giving our lectures using teams (and anything we can get our hands on!). 

To give you the best possible quality of teaching, Mark and Jon are going to work together on the teaching sessions this year with one of us leading the lecture and the other acting as the producer and interjecting with questions and facts. We'll do our utmost to allow everyone the ability to interact and ask questions. We're planning on livestreaming the lectures via Teams, whilst simultaneously making video recordings. We strongly encourage you to get involved by virtually raising your hand to speak out questions, or type questions into the chat to which we can respond. We've also got some other tricks planned to keep the module as engaging as it has been in previous years.

In terms of content, Mark will lead the lectures for the first part of the course, and Jon will finish with the second half.  There will be three lectures each week up to around the end of the eighth teaching week; you'll then have about time to work on your final coursework. Because of the later start to term this year, the group coursework will be submitted after the Christmas vacation.

Jon will make himself available during the lecture slots of weeks 9 and 10 for anyone looking for help or guidance. We'll also likely throw in a couple of bonus lectures during the last weeks to cover additional material and give feedback. After the Christmas vacation we'll run a revision lecture and also give feedback (and hopefully prizes!) for the group coursework. 

The lecture slots are (currently) as follows -- keep an eye on your timetable for any changes:

Day       | Time | Room   
----------|------|-----------------------
Monday    | 1PM  | Teams
Friday    | 11AM | Teams
Friday    | 1PM  | Teams

* [Part 1](part1.html) taught by Mark.
* [Part 2](part2.html) taught by Jon.

Links to video recordings of the lectures will also be added once

## Assessment

This is a split exam and coursework module. Past exam papers can be [found on the web](https://www.adminservices.soton.ac.uk/adminweb/jsp/pastPapers/pastPapers.jsp) (hint search for "Computer Vision" rather than the module code to see a long list of historic, but largely still relevant, past papers). We're still waiting for guidance on the exact form that the exam paper will take this year.

### Coursework

The schedule for each coursework is shown below, and details will become available below as each coursework is set. Deadline dates are currently provisional as deadlines might be moved by the Director of Programmes to minimise conflicts with other assignments from different modules. Note the slightly unusual timings (the first coursework to be set is handed in after the second - this is intentional).
