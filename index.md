Welcome to the homepage for the ECS [COMP3204 "Computer Vision"](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP3204) module. 

The challenge of computer vision is to develop a computer based system with the capabilities of the human eye-brain system. It is therefore primarily concerned with the problem of capturing and making sense of digital images. The field draws heavily on many subjects including digital image processing, artificial intelligence, computer graphics and psychology.

This course will explore some of the basic principles and techniques from these areas which are currently being used in real-world computer vision systems and the research and development of new systems.

<!-- The following short video gives an overview of what to expect in the module.

## Lectures & Teaching

The lectures for this course will be given by [Dr Xiaohao Cai](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/xc1f20) ([email](mailto:xc1f20@soton.ac.uk)) and <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jsh2">Dr Jonathon Hare</a> ([email](mailto:jsh2@ecs.soton.ac.uk)). Xiaohao will give the lectures for the first part of the course, and Jon will finish with the second half. 

There will be three lectures each week up to around the end of week 8; you'll then have about three weeks to work on your final coursework. We'll also likely throw in a couple of bonus lectures during the last weeks to cover additional material and give feedback. After the Christmas vacation we'll run a revision lecture and also give feedback (and prizes!) for the group coursework. 

We strongly encourage you to get involved by asking questions in the lectures - please don't be shy. Expect that we'll also ask for help from the audience from time=to-time too.

The lecture slots are (currently) as follows -- keep an eye on your timetable for any changes:

Day       | Time | Room   
----------|------|-----------------------
Mondays   | 12PM | 42/Cinema (SUSU Cinema)
Tuesdays  | 2PM  | 2A/2065 (Arts Annex L/T H)
Fridays   | 4PM  | 58/1067 (Murray L/T)

## Assessment

This is a split exam and coursework module. Past exam papers can be [found on the web](https://www.adminservices.soton.ac.uk/adminweb/jsp/pastPapers/pastPapers.jsp) (hint search for "Computer Vision" rather than the module code to see a long list of historic, but largely still relevant, past papers). We're still waiting for guidance on the exact form that the exam paper will take this year.

### Coursework

The schedule for each coursework is shown below, and details will become available below as each coursework is set. Deadline dates are currently provisional as deadlines might be moved by the Director of Programmes to minimise conflicts with other assignments from different modules. Note the slightly unusual timings (the first coursework to be set is handed in after the second - this is intentional).
